# Speed-test-for-typing-the-letters-of-the-alphabet
Data Structures and Algorithms, Assignment 1

In this assignment, you will write a program for reading in the letters of the alphabet, one at a time, in order from the console. The user should press enter between each letter and incorrect letters in the sequence should be ignored. Once the user has typed the letters in the correct sequence, the program should tell them how long it took to complete. The user can also decide if they would like to type the letters forwards or backwards.
